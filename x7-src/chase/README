Chase
-----

A distributed object store that was originally developed as the basis for 
Rackspace's Cloud Files.

To build documentation run `python setup.py build_sphinx`, and then browse to
/doc/build/html/index.html.

The best place to get started is the "SAIO - Chase All In One", which will walk
you through setting up a development cluster of Chase in a VM.

For more information, visit us at http://launchpad.net/chase, or come hang out
on our IRC channel, #x7 on freenode.
