Python bindings to the X7 Keystone API
==================================================

This is a client for X7 Keystone API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`keystoneclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`keystone`).

You'll need an `X7 Keystone` account, which you can get by
using `keystone-manage`.
