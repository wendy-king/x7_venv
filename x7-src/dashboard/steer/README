========================================
Steer: The X7 Dashboard Project
========================================

The Steer project is a Django module that is used to provide web based
interactions with an X7 cloud.

There is a reference implementation that uses this module located at:

    http://launchpad.net/steer

It is highly recommended that you make use of this reference implementation
so that changes you make can be visualized effectively and are consistent.
Using this reference implementation as a development environment will greatly
simplify development of the ``steer`` module.

Of course, if you are developing your own Django site using Steer, then
you can disregard this advice.


Getting Started
===============

Steer uses the common environment configured by ``tools/install_venv.py``
based on the dependencies listed in ``tools/pip-requires`` for local
development.

The simplest way to get going is to simply run the ``run_tests.sh`` script
included with the Steer project. This will set up your local environment
and run the full test suite to verify that everything is working properly.
